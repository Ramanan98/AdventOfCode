# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each day's solution and input data is in a separate folder.

## 🚀 Running Solutions

Each day's solution can be run independently:
* Navigate to the respective directory.
* Go to the link in the first line of the solution, log in, and save your input for the problem as `input.txt`.
* Run the specific day's solution:

```bash
python puzzle.py
```

Replace `XX` with the day number (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.)

## 📝 Solution Format

Each solution file follows a consistent format:
- Input is read from the `input.txt` file in the respective directory.
- Solutions print the answers to both parts.
